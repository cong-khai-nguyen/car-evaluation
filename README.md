# Car Evaluation

# Description
This project is a bit different than "Student Performance" project. This uses K-Nearest Neighbors or KNN algorithm to train and classify all the cars from data set into four main categories: unacc, acc, good, vgood. Using KNN model, I was able to classify correctly 95% of the testing data.
The data set can also be found at this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation
